    <h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
    <p>
      Overall, it s a great story and I love the dynamic between the two main
      characters.

    <h3>Seven Deadly Sins</h3>
    <p>It's a good anime, full of fighting and some religious insight.</p>
    <h3>500 Days of Summer</h3>
    <p>
      It made me feel something i've never felt before so deeply, the fear of
      losing my lover
